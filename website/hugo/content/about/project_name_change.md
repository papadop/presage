In July 2008, Soothsayer project leader and developer Matteo Vescovi was contacted by a company called [Applied Human Factors](http://www.ahf-net.com/) (AHF) in relation to the "Soothsayer" project name.

AHF, who had been selling an application called *Soothsayer Word Prediction* for 12 years, kindly and respectfully requested that the name of the Soothsayer project be changed, in order to avoid confusion with their *Soothsayer Word Prediction* product.

Matteo recognised their concern and found their request reasonable.

After carefully considering the matter and <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2008/07/msg00083.html">seeking some advice</a>, Matteo resolved to comply with their request to change the soothsayer project name, despite the fact that the soothsayer name had begun to <a href="?q=node/20">receive some attention</a>.

The choice of a new project name eventually settled on *Presage*.

**Noun**  
**presage** (*plural* presages)

  * An intuition of a future event; a presentiment.

**Verb**  
**to presage** (*third-person singular simple present* presages, *present participle* presaging, *simple past and past participle* presaged)

  * (transitive) To predict or foretell something.
  * (intransitive) To make a prediction.


The Presage project name was chosen because:

  * of its meaning, both as a noun and a verb
  * it was not used by any other software project
  * it had a similar evocative and mysterious feel to it
