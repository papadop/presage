Communication is a basic human need. Electronic text is an increasingly important communication medium. Textual interaction and electronic text generation are essential to effective communication.

However, electronic text generation may be cumbersome if:

  * the device is equipped with a limited text entry system, such as devices lacking a standard keyboard, i.e. portable devices, PDAs and mobile phones
  * the user has physical or linguistic disabilities which might impair their speed, accuracy, or altogether prevent their access to electronic text creation

A predictive text entry system attempts to improve the ease and speed of textual input.

Word prediction consists in computing which word tokens or word completions are most likely to be entered next. The system analyses the text already entered and combines the information thus extracted with other information sources to calculate a set of most probable tokens.

The set of most probable tokens, a list of suggestions, is displayed to the user. If the token the user intended to enter is in the list, the user selects it and it is automatically entered by the system.

If the list of suggestions does not contain the desired word, the user enters the next character until the correct suggestion is offered or until the user has completed entering the desired text.
