Presage provides a powerful predictive text entry system, but there is so much more to be done! Everyone is invited to help project development and contribute to presage library and applications.


## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to presage development, the [getting started guide](/documentation#quick-start) is a good place to start. The existing [source code documentation](/documentation#developers-api) is also a good resource to gain a high level overview of the project.

Once you are ready to get coding, be sure to:

  * Learn how to access our [source code repository](#source-code-repository) to get the latest and greatest presage. Build presage on your platform of choice. Run the extensive testsuite. If you find a bug, fix it, test your fix, send in a patch. Rinse, lather and repeat.
  * Take a look at the current [TODO list](http://sourceforge.net/p/presage/presage/ci/master/tree/TODO) for get an idea of desired feature enhancements or improvements to presage's functionality.
  * [Get in touch](/contact) to announce your intention to contribute to presage. Find out what other developers are currently working on and coordinate your work to avoid duplicating effort.
