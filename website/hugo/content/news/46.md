# Summary:
# Presage 0.8.1 is now available for <a href="?q=node/16">download</a>.
# 
# Presage 0.8.1 sports significant performance improvements in its smoothed n-gram predictor. Runtime execution was sped up by approximately a factor of 5 by tuning some expensive SQL queries to the embedded SQLite database.
# 
# Presage 0.8.1 comes with refactored configuration and profile handling subsystems. Configuration is read from system-level, installation-level, user-level XML profiles and from an optional user-specified profile. Changes to configuration variables made at runtime through the config() API can now be persisted to file by calling the new save_profile() API method. Presage components are also immediately notified of configuration changes and adjust accordingly.
# 
# Presage 0.8.1 also includes other bug fixes and enhancements. Compilation problems on recent stricter compilers, compilation warnings, and minor memory leaks were fixed in this release. Please see the ChangeLog for more details.
