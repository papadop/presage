# Summary:
# Presage has been used as the predictive engine in the Predictor Input Method, an experimental <a href="http://www.gtk.org/api/2.6/gtk/GtkIMContext.html">GTK+ Input Method</a> offering a novel and interesting predictive text entry approach. <a href="http://www.joaquimrocha.com/2010/03/03/text-prediction-on-gnome/">Read more</a> about the implementation of this GTK+ Predictor Input Method and <a href="http://vimeo.com/9867486">watch a demo</a> of the predictor method in action.
# 
# Presage has been used in <a href="https://live.gnome.org/Caribou">Caribou</a>, a text entry and UI navigation application being developed as an alternative to the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/Gok">Gnome On-screen Keyboard</a>. The overarching goal for Caribou is to create a usable solution for people whose primary way of accessing a computer is a switch device. <a href="http://dpellicer.warp.es/?p=6">Read more</a> about the Caribou prototype offering predictive functionality has been implemented using the Presage DBUS service and <a href="http://vimeo.com/11686075">watch a demo</a> of it in action.
# 
# Finally, check out this <a href="http://www.joaquimrocha.com/2010/04/05/caribou-and-text-predictor-input-mode/">write-up</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/10687630">demo</a> about Caribou and the Predictor Text Input Method used together and powered by presage.
