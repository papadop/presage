Soothsayer website gets a new look.

Admittedly, the previous red/orange/pink look was not particularly pleasant nor easy on the eyes. Put it blunty, it was rather ugly.

The new design was carefully crafted using state-of-the-art web design tools such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>. Yeah. The soothsayer logo was a labour of love created with <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">inkscape</a> in about one minute flat.

I used the excellent <a href="http://drupal.org/project/zen"/>Zen</a> theme for <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> as a starting point, and chiseled it to suit my taste.

I hope you like it.
