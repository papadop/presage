# Summary:
# Soothsayer website gets a new look.
# 
# Admittedly, the previous red/orange/pink look was not particularly pleasant nor easy on the eyes. Put it blunty, it was rather ugly.
# 
# The new design was carefully crafted using state-of-the-art web design tools such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>. The soothsayer logo was created with <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">inkscape</a> in about one minute.
# 
# I used the excellent <a href="http://drupal.org/project/zen"/>Zen</a> theme for <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a> as a starting point, and chiseled it to taste.
# 
# I hope you like it.
