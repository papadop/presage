# Summary:
# Presage 0.9 is now available for <a href="?q=node/16">download</a>.
# 
# Presage 0.9 features a new .NET binding. .NET applications can now easily integrate with presage by using the presage.NET assembly. The native C++ presage core is wrapped using P/Invoke functionality provided by the .NET framework. A C# demo application illustrates how simple it is to use presage.net in .NET (bindings/c#).
# 
# Presage 0.9 now supports the <a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/">MinGW-w64</a> 64-bit and 32-bit toolchains from the MinGW-builds project. Detailed instructions on how to build with the MinGW-w64 toolchains are available in doc/INSTALL_MinGW64_MSYS_dev_env.txt and doc/INSTALL_MinGW32_MSYS_dev_env.txt. Pre-built Windows installers are also available.
