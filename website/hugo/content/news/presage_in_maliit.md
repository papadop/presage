[Maliit](http://maliit.github.io/) provides a flexible and cross-platform input method framework for mobile text input, including a virtual keyboard. It has a plugin-based client-server architecture where applications act as clients and communicate with the Maliit server via input context plugins.

Presage has been selected as the predictive text engine to enable word prediction functionality in Maliit.

"Presage certainly has a lot of potential. It comes with an easy to use C++ API but also provides bindings for C and Python. In fact, it even provides a D-Bus API, which would make it possible to run it as a system service. The user could then benefit from (and train!) the same language models from different applications."

Michael Hasselmann has also developed a Maliit prototype that mimicks the new Blackberry 10 virtual keyboard word prediction functionality. [Read more](https://web.archive.org/web/20130517215643/http://mikhas.posterous.com/multi-word-ribbon-ui-for-maliit) about it and check out the video:
