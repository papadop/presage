On 3, July 2008, I received an email from a software company called [Applied Human Factors](http://www.ahf-net.com/), who have been selling an application called ``Soothsayer Word Prediction`` for the past 12 years.

They kindly and respectfully requested that I change the name of the soothsayer project, so that it is not confused with their ``Soothsayer Word Prediction`` product.

I understand their concern and find their request very reasonable.
I intend to comply with their request and change the project name, despite the fact that the soothsayer name had begun to [receive some attention](http://www.linux.com/feature/135093).

The new project name is "Presage". [Read more](/about/project_name_change/) about the background and motivation for changing to the new Presage project name.

Apologies to all Soothsayer users for the short-term discomfort caused by the name change. Please bear with us while the change over to the new project name is carried out over the next few days.

Soothsayer is dead! Long live Presage!
