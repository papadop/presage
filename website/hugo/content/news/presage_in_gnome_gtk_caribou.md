Presage has been used as the predictive engine in the Predictor Input Method, an experimental <a href="http://www.gtk.org/api/2.6/gtk/GtkIMContext.html">GTK+ Input Method</a> offering a novel and interesting predictive text entry approach. <a href="http://www.joaquimrocha.com/2010/03/03/text-prediction-on-gnome/">Read more</a> about the implementation of this GTK+ Predictor Input Method and watch a demo of the predictor method in action:

Presage has been used in [Caribou](https://live.gnome.org/Caribou), a text entry and UI navigation application being developed as an alternative to the [Gnome On-screen Keyboard](https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/Gok). The overarching goal for Caribou is to create a usable solution for people whose primary way of accessing a computer is a switch device.
