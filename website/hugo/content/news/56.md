# Summary:
# <a href="https://wiki.maliit.org/Main_Page">Maliit</a> provides a flexible and cross-platform input method framework for mobile text input, including a virtual keyboard. It has a plugin-based client-server architecture where applications act as clients and communicate with the Maliit server via input context plugins.
# 
# Presage has been selected as the predictive text engine to enable word prediction functionality in Maliit.
# 
# <a href="http://mikhas.posterous.com/maliit-keyboard-now-with-word-prediction-and">Read more</a> about presage integration in Maliit on Michael Hasselmann's blog and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXNWHP7Qd9c&feature=player_embedded">check out the video</a>.
# 
# "Presage certainly has a lot of potential. It comes with an easy to use C++ API but also provides bindings for C and Python. In fact, it even provides a D-Bus API, which would make it possible to run it as a system service. The user could then benefit from (and train!) the same language models from different applications."
# 
# Michael Hasselmann has also developed a Maliit prototype that mimicks the new Blackberry 10 virtual keyboard word prediction functionality. <a href="http://mikhas.posterous.com/multi-word-ribbon-ui-for-maliit">Read more</a> about it and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHbtN4UU0E&feature=player_embedded">check out the video</a>.
